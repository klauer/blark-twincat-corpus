# blark TwinCAT corpus

A start of a collection of TwinCAT repositories that I hope blark parses correctly.

For now, a myopic view of the TwinCAT world: it contains PLC code from SLAC's LCLS.

Contributions are welcome - there's a better chance blark will maintain parsing
compatibility with your code if it's here.
